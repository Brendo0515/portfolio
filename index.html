    <h1>Brendon Tseng's Thomson Reuters Summer 2019 Internship</h1>
    <h2>About Brendon</h2>
    <p>
        I am a passionate college junior working towards a BA in Communications and Media at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. 
        I am seeking to apply strategic, analytical, and technical skills to a career that offers opportunities for learning, growth, and making an impact.  
        In the future, I hope to pursue UX Design and research.  My whole life, I have been facinated by digital media, software, and the internet, 
        and I grew up knowing that I wanted to spend my life learning and contributing to the digital space. In my spare time, I enjoy playing online video games with my friends (Overwatch is my favorite), 
        browsing YouTube and Reddit, and occasionly streaming on Twitch.tv.

        I chose to work at Thomson Reuters during the summer of 2019 because I was looking for a great way to start my career in the information, tech 
        and software industry.  TR stood out to me because of its emphasis on the customer and company relationship built on trust.  They are a company that prioritized the user first, 
        and this can be seen through every aspect of the company, from new hire training to the design of their products.  
        TR also focuses a lot on the wellbeing of their employees, both in and out of the office.  They regularly hold office and volunteer events to shake up the cycle of work.
        TR's work culture instantly stood out to me and I knew after researching the company that I wanted to work there.
